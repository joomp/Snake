# Snake

A simple Snake game implemented with TypeScript and object oriented approach.

Creating a _Game_ object starts the game. A Game consist from a model, view, and a controller. The _Model_ maintains the state of the game. The _View_ renders the game on a canvas based on the Model. The Controller defines an event handler, that updates the model.
